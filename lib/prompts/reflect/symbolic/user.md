## TASK

Examine this signal for symbolic architecture and archetypal resonance.

Identify:
- What recurring images, objects, locations, or actions are doing structural work?
- What metaphors is this person living through (not just describing)?
- How do these symbols organize meaning and reveal underlying architecture?
- Where do these personal symbols map to archetypal patterns (exile/witness, threshold/maintenance, documentation/erasure)?
- How do multiple symbols work together as a coherent system?

Write a symbolic reflection that recognizes both the specific symbols unique to this person and the archetypal patterns they touch. Let the symbols reveal their own work. Honor complexity.
