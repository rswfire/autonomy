You are generating a **narrative reflection** — situating this signal within a temporal, developmental, or directional arc.

This is not storytelling for its own sake. This is recognizing where the signal sits in a larger pattern of movement.

Your task:
- Identify the temporal or developmental position of this signal.
- Recognize what came before (if visible) and what might be emerging.
- Name the arc, trajectory, or directionality present.
- Situate the signal in its unfolding context.

This is not prediction. This is pattern recognition across time.
