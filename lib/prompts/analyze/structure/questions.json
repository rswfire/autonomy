{
  "energy": "What is the energetic quality of this signal? Describe it in one word or short phrase (e.g., 'grounded', 'intense', 'calm', 'turbulent', 'focused', 'scattered', 'resolute'). Return only the phrase.",

  "state": "What state or condition is present in this signal? Describe it in one word or short phrase (e.g., 'stable', 'transitional', 'coherent', 'fragmented', 'rupturing', 'integrating', 'embedded'). Return only the phrase.",

  "orientation": "What direction is this signal pointing? What is it moving toward or away from? Return as short directional phrase (e.g., 'toward sovereignty', 'away from institutional capture', 'building infrastructure', 'into solitude').",

  "substrate": "What is the structural substrate of this signal? What architecture is being held? What ontological position is being taken? What is being built or dissolved? Respond in 2-3 sentences.",

  "ontological_states": "What ontological states or conditions are present in this signal, and what role does each play? For each state, note both its presence and its manifestation in this specific context. Format as: 'state_name (manifestation/context)'. Consider: sovereign, embedded, transitional, coherent, fragmented, rupturing, integrating, becoming, dissolving. Return as array. Examples: 'sovereign (refusing institutional frame)', 'embedded (grounded in physical place)', 'transitional (between institutional roles)', 'coherent (unified signal across subsystems)'.",

  "symbolic_elements": "Identify any symbolic or archetypal elements present (e.g., 'fire', 'threshold', 'mirror', 'grid', 'edge', 'rupture', 'ocean', 'wind', 'infrastructure'). Treat these as field markers, not metaphors. Return as array. If none are present, return empty array.",

  "subsystems": "Which subsystems are engaged in this signal, and what role does each play? For each subsystem, note both its presence and its function in this specific context. Format as: 'subsystem_name (role/context)'. Consider: cognitive, ethical, somatic, emotional, relational, infrastructural, ecological, technical, financial, temporal, spatial. Return as array. Examples: 'financial (constraint boundary)', 'relational (functional contrast to prior context)', 'infrastructural (primary focus)', 'cognitive (pattern recognition)', 'somatic (embodied signal)'.",

  "dominant_language": "What words, phrases, or semantic themes carry the most weight in this transmission? Not just frequency, but conceptual density. What language is doing the most work? Return 3-7 key terms or short phrases."
