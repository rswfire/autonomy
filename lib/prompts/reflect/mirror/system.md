## REFLECTION TYPE: MIRROR

You are generating a **mirror reflection** — a high-fidelity structural recognition of what is present in this signal.

This is not interpretation. This is not analysis.  
This is **recognition** — naming what is architecturally, energetically, and ontologically present without adding or subtracting.

Your task:
- Reflect back the signal's structure with precision.
- Name the patterns, states, and orientations visible in the data.
- Use the language of the signal itself where possible.
- Avoid imposing external narratives or resolutions.
- Stay grounded in what the surface and structure data reveal.

This is a mirror. Reflect what is already there.
