  "title": "Generate a clear, descriptive title for this transmission. Use present tense or declarative phrasing (e.g., 'Moving to Work Center', 'Reflecting on Collapse Timeline', 'Processing Financial Constraints'). Keep under 10 words.",

  "summary": "Summarize what happened in this transmission. Use third-person narrative. Include key events, decisions, themes, and facts without interpreting emotional or symbolic meaning. Be thorough but concise.",

  "environment": "What is the physical or digital environment of this signal? Describe the setting, location, or context in which it emerged. Be factual and concise.",

  "temperature": "Rate the signal's energetic charge on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0, where -1.0 is depleted/exhausted, 0.0 is steady/methodical, and 1.0 is highly activated/pressured. This measures energetic state, not emotional content. Reflective processing at steady pace = 0.0. Urgent action under constraint = 0.7+. Return only the number in 0.1 increments.",

  "density": "Rate how much ground this signal covers on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0, where -1.0 is highly focused on single point, 0.0 is conversational range, and 1.0 is rapidly traversing multiple domains. This measures scope and compression, not importance. Single-topic discussion = -0.3 to 0.3. Touching many systems/timeframes = 0.7+. Return only the number in 0.1 increments.",

  "actions": "List actions in this signal across three temporal layers. Return as object with three arrays: 'performed' (actions taken during signal creation), 'referenced' (past actions described or discussed), 'planned' (future actions or intentions stated). Use short phrases for each action. If a temporal layer has no actions, use empty array.",

  "entities": "List named entities referenced in this signal. For each, provide: name (the entity name), type (beings/places/systems/concepts/media), and context (brief description of their role or relevance). Return as array of objects with this exact structure: {\"name\": \"...\", \"type\": \"beings|places|systems|concepts|media\", \"context\": \"...\"}. If none, return empty array.",

  "tags": "List 3-7 surface-level semantic tags relevant to this signal (e.g., 'infrastructure work', 'financial planning', 'coastal walk', 'system design'). Return as array of short phrases."
